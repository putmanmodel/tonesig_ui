# ToneS¡g! Emotional Match UI

ToneS¡g! is a local symbolic tone-matching demo powered by the PUTMAN Model. It allows emotional expressions to be tagged, searched, and mapped with tone precision — without needing any cloud connection or training runs. You can think of it as an emotional search engine for language fragments.

> "Computers see without eyes, hear without ears, and now — thanks to ToneS¡g! — they can *feel* without a soul."

### 🎯 What's Included

This demo includes **10 starter tone blocks**, each representing a distinct emotional posture or resonance field. These were hand-tagged and tone-coded as a proof-of-concept set. The full system can easily scale to hundreds or thousands of tone clusters.

#### Current Tone Blocks

1. **¡10.000** – Curiosity / Intellectual Play  
2. **¡11.000** – Reverence / Gentle Wonder  
3. **¡12.000** – Emotional Attraction / Pull  
4. **¡13.000** – Control / Authority / Cold Precision  
5. **¡14.000** – Care / Reassurance  
6. **¡15.000** – Boundaries / Assertive Anger  
7. **¡16.000** – Interest / Optimistic Engagement  
8. **¡17.000** – Neglect / Resentful Resignation  
9. **¡18.000** – Surprise / Startle / Interruption  
10. **¡19.000** – Soft Awe / Liminal Mystery

Each block contains 100 lines of emotionally resonant language with a unique tone signature (`¡XX.YYY`). All tones are fully symbolic and intentionally built for machine empathy.
